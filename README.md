# My First Full-Stack Mobile Application Project
## E-Commerce Application (DRKSDE) 
created from May 18, 2022 -  Jun 15, 2022
- A vans-styled e-commerce mobile application design created by James de Sousa [@jamesdesousa](https://www.figma.com/@jamesdesousa) from Figma. 
Here's the link of the design. 
```bash
